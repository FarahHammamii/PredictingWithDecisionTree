The goal of this project is to create a Decision Tree classifier that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
The classifier is trained on a dataset, and once trained, it can be used to predict the species of new Iris flowers based on these measurements.
